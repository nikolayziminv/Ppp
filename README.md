# P++
P++... it's when c++ and processing are together... that is...

Sorry for my english, really...

When you load archive with PPP to your computer, you will do next:

1. Create PPP directory (or another directory, no matter) ad "C:\" (<- That is important, i'm not kidding!)
2. Create PPP System Variable with full path to this directory (with directory name in it)
3. Unpack arhive to this directory

it will looks like "C:\somedir\---Ñ‚-bin
                                  |-lib
                                  |-wscitePpp
                                  |-compile.cmd
                                  
But that's not all!

4. Add "C:\somedir\bin\freeglut\bin(\x64)"(if you have x64 monster),"C:\somedir\bin\freeglut\include" and 
"C:\somedir\bin\freeglut\lib(\x64)(for the same reason)" to your system PATH.
After that...
5. find "PpDE.exe" in "wscitePpp" directory and make a shortcut on desktop.
Thats all, maybe it will work... maybe not...

Now serious - that is Processing3 implementation on C++, but i work on it alone[0], and, for that reason, work will be slow. 
You can do everything you want with this code, but you can't:

- sell it;
- make it commercial and sell it;
- making anything else for selling it as part of some, you know, "package", or not in package....
- SELL IT!

we have too much properitare, high coasted s.h.i.t.[1], that costs too much to buy it, don't do the same with P++, ok?)

best wishes!)

P.S.
- 0: one guy pretends that he is interested in it too, but when i don't look at him, he don't work :|, but he made some functions himself :)
